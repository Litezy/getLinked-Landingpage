# getLinked-Landingpage
Hi welcome,
Prior to this project i was going through my X(formerly twitter) timeline and stumbled on the post from one Mr David Herbert👨🏽‍💻🚀
@DaveyHert to get to build a landing page with pixel perfect responsivity and it was a challenge to all devs on his timeline. so i took interest to partake in it, its my third month in tech so i decided to give it a go.
Albeit i didnt get through with my work because i wanted to get my hands dirty and get more knowledge other than going for the prize, it took me more time and also because i am (at the moment) not familiar with any framewok, only vanilla. about 2 or 3 devs won the challenge and they said they used JS framework called (React). which i will get familiar with soon enough.
I am glad i got to get through to the end of this project as it helped me a lot in gaining more esperience into solving problems through web technology languages and stylesheets.
This project really helped me improve on my vanilla Css journey.
Most importantly it helped me with improvements in form validation in Javascript. i hope you find this body of work pleasant and with the experience garnered in this project i know it will propel more greater heights in the future for me.

i remain grateful to see you come here and read this little write up. Thanks.
